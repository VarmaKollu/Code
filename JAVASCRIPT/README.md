A 90-day plan for learning JavaScript programming problems, taking you from a beginner to a more advanced level, involves a structured approach, regular practice, and a balance of theoretical and hands-on learning. Here's a comprehensive plan:

Days 1-10: Establishing the Basics

Days 1-3: Introduction to JavaScript

Learn the history and importance of JavaScript.
Set up a development environment (IDE or text editor) and write your first "Hello, World!" program in JavaScript.
Days 4-7: Variables and Data Types

Study fundamental data types (number, string, boolean) and variable declaration.
Practice variable assignments and basic data manipulation.
Days 8-10: Control Structures

Understand conditional statements (if, else) and loops (for, while).
Create simple programs to apply decision-making and loops.
Days 11-30: Deepening Your Knowledge

Days 11-14: Functions

Learn about functions, parameters, and return values.
Write functions and practice function calls with various use cases.
Days 15-18: Arrays and Arrays Manipulation

Create programs that manipulate arrays, such as sorting or filtering.
Days 19-23: Objects and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

Understand objects, properties, and methods.
Begin working with objects and practice object-oriented programming concepts.
Days 24-27: DOM Manipulation

Learn how to interact with the Document Object Model (DOM) using JavaScript.
Create interactive web pages by manipulating DOM elements.
Days 28-30: Basic Problem Solving
