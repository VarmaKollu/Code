#### Days 4-7: Variables and Data Types

- Study fundamental data types (int, float, str, etc.) and variable assignment.
- Practice basic arithmetic operations and type conversions.

#### Days 8-10: Control Structures

- Understand conditional statements (if, else, elif) and loops (for, while).
- Write programs involving decision-making and iteration.

## Days 11-30: Deepening Your Knowledge
------------------------------------------------

#### Days 11-14: Lists and Tuples

- Learn about data structures like lists and tuples.
- Practice operations on these data structures and explore their methods.
