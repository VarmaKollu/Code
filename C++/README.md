# C++ Programming Language 90 Days Plan
Learning C++ from a beginner to a pro-level requires dedication and a well-structured plan. Here's a 90-day plan for mastering C++:

## Days 1-10: Building the Foundations
-----------------------------------------------------

#### Days 1-3: Introduction to C++

- Learn about the history and importance of C++.
- Set up a C++ development environment and write your first "Hello, World!" program.
#### Days 4-7: Variables and Data Types

- Study fundamental data types (int, double, char, etc.) and variable declaration.
- Practice variable assignments and basic arithmetic operations.

#### Days 8-10: Control Structures

- Understand conditional statements (if, else) and loops (for, while).
- Write programs involving decision-making and loops.

## Days 11-30: Deepening Your Knowledge
----------------------------------------------------------

#### Days 11-14: Functions and Function Overloading

- Learn about functions, function parameters, and return values.
- Practice function overloading and learn about function templates.

#### Days 15-18: Arrays and Vectors

- Study C++ arrays and the Standard Template Library (STL) vector.
- Create programs that manipulate arrays and vectors.

#### Days 19-23: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

- Understand OOP concepts like classes, objects, inheritance, and encapsulation.
- Create classes and objects in C++.

#### Days 24-27: File Handling

- Learn how to open, read, write, and close files in C++.
