-----------------------------------------------------------

#### Days 1-3: Introduction to Solidity

- Learn about Ethereum and the role of smart contracts.
- Set up a development environment, such as Remix, and create a simple "Hello, Ethereum" smart contract.

#### Days 4-7: Variables and Data Types

- Study the fundamental data types in Solidity (uint, int, address, etc.).
- Create simple contracts to declare and manipulate variables.

#### Days 8-10: Control Structures

- Understand conditional statements (if, else) and loops (for, while) in Solidity.
- Write basic smart contracts with decision-making and iteration.

## Days 11-30: Deepening Your Knowledge
--------------------------------------------------------------------

#### Days 11-14: Functions and Modifiers

- Learn about functions and modifiers in Solidity.
- Practice creating functions and applying modifiers to control access.

#### Days 15-18: Arrays and Mapping

- Explore arrays and mappings in Solidity.
- Create smart contracts that use data structures for storage and retrieval.

#### Days 19-23: Event Handling

- Understand how to emit events in Solidity for logging and notifications.
- Write contracts that utilize events for interaction.

#### Days 24-27: Solidity Best Practices

- Learn about common coding patterns and best practices.
- Review existing contracts and apply best practices to your code.

#### Days 28-30: Basic Problem Solving

- Start solving simple problems related to smart contracts.
