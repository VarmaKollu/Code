A 90-day plan for learning JavaScript programming problems, taking you from a beginner to a more advanced level, involves a structured approach, regular practice, and a balance of theoretical and hands-on learning. Here's a comprehensive plan:

## Days 1-10: Establishing the Basics
------------------------------------------------

#### 1-3: Introduction to JavaScript

- Learn the history and importance of JavaScript.
- Set up a development environment (IDE or text editor) and write your first "Hello, World!" program in JavaScript.

#### 4-7: Variables and Data Types

- Study fundamental data types (number, string, boolean) and variable declaration.
- Practice variable assignments and basic data manipulation.
- 
#### 8-10: Control Structures

- Understand conditional statements (if, else) and loops (for, while).
- Create simple programs to apply decision-making and loops.

## Days 11-30: Deepening Your Knowledge
------------------------------------------------

#### 11-14: Functions

- Learn about functions, parameters, and return values.
- Write functions and practice function calls with various use cases.

#### 15-18: Arrays and Arrays Manipulation

- Explore JavaScript arrays and array methods.
- Create programs that manipulate arrays, such as sorting or filtering.

#### 19-23: Objects and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

- Understand objects, properties, and methods.
- Begin working with objects and practice object-oriented programming concepts.

#### 24-27: DOM Manipulation

- Learn how to interact with the Document Object Model (DOM) using JavaScript.
- Create interactive web pages by manipulating DOM elements.

#### 28-30: Basic Problem Solving

- Start solving simple problems using JavaScript.
- Focus on improving your problem-solving skills.

## Days 31-60: Intermediate Level Skills
-----------------------------------------------------------

#### 31-40: Asynchronous JavaScript

- Study asynchronous programming concepts, including callbacks, promises, and async/await.
- Implement asynchronous code to fetch data and handle async operations.

#### 41-50: Event Handling and Event Listeners

- Learn how to handle events and set up event listeners in JavaScript.
- Create interactive web applications with event-driven functionality.

#### 51-55: Debugging and Error Handling

- Learn debugging techniques in the browser's developer tools.
- Practice error handling and debugging your JavaScript code.

#### 56-60: Intermediate Problem Solving

- Tackle more complex programming problems using JavaScript.
- Experiment with algorithms and data structures.

## Days 61-90: Mastery and Advanced Challenges
------------------------------------------------------------

#### 61-70: Advanced JavaScript Concepts

- Study advanced topics such as closures, this keyword, and functional programming in JavaScript.
- Practice writing JavaScript code with these concepts in mind.

#### 71-80: JavaScript Frameworks and Libraries

- Explore popular JavaScript frameworks and libraries like React, Angular, or Vue.
- Build a project using one of these technologies to apply your knowledge.

#### 81-85: Advanced Problem-Solving Challenges

- Continue working on challenging problems on platforms like LeetCode, CodeSignal, or Codewars.
- Enhance your problem-solving skills and refine your algorithms.

#### 86-90: Personal Projects

- Develop a personal project using JavaScript.
- Build a web application, a browser extension, or any software that interests you.
